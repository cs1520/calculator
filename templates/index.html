      <h4>Project Proposal requirements</h4>
      <p>Your team will need to turn in a one-page document containing:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Description of the project</li>
        <li>You team's vision for your MVP</li>
        <li>Plans for M1</li>
        <li>Plans for M2</li>
        <li>Plans for end of term</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I only need one proposal per group, but I will need everyone's names and email addresses on it somewhere. You can email submissions to <a href="mailto:jake.stambaugh@gmail.com">jake.stambaugh@gmail.com</a>. If you have specific questions about your proposal, <a href="http://jvs.gr1.me/office">schedule some time during my office hours.</a></p>
